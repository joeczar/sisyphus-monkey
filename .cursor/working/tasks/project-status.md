# Sisyphus Monkey Project Status
Last Updated: March 2024

## Current Status üéØ

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Core Architecture Simplification**
   - Removed Neo4j dependency
   - Removed Redis dependency
   - Simplified to SQLite-only storage
   - Cleaned up unnecessary services

2. **Dictionary Processing**
   - Dictionary files split by letter
   - TypeScript types defined
   - Trie implementation working

3. **Word Finding**
   - Trie service implemented and tested
   - Efficient caching system
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - SQLite integration complete
   - Subword discovery working

4. **Data Storage**
   - SQLite service implemented
   - Complete test coverage
   - Schema designed for:
     - Character chunks
     - Words
     - Word packets
     - Poems

5. **Display System**
   - Scrolling text implementation
   - Paginated output
   - Color-coded feedback
   - Progress indicators

### üöß In Progress
1. **Configuration Management**
   - [ ] Testing different packet sizes
   - [ ] Testing different chunk sizes
   - [ ] Creating centralized config system
   - [ ] Adding command-line configuration

2. **Poetry Generation Tuning**
   - [ ] Testing with various packet sizes
   - [ ] Documenting quality metrics
   - [ ] Optimizing prompt templates

### üìã Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **High Priority** (Next Session)
   - [ ] Test with small word packets (5-10 words)
   - [ ] Document poetry quality at different sizes
   - [ ] Create centralized configuration file

2. **Medium Priority** (Next Few Days)
   - [ ] Test medium packet sizes (20-30 words)
   - [ ] Test larger chunk sizes
   - [ ] Add configuration command line arguments

3. **Lower Priority** (Later)
   - [ ] Add visualization/UI
   - [ ] Optimize performance
   - [ ] Add more poetry styles

## Development Tips üß†

### Focus Sessions
- Use 25-minute Pomodoro sessions
- Take 5-minute breaks between sessions
- After 4 sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break

### Task Management
- Check off items as they're completed
- Update configuration-settings.md regularly
- Keep notes on poetry quality

### Code Organization
- Keep related changes together
- Write tests as you go
- Document key decisions

## Questions & Considerations ‚ùì
1. What is the optimal packet size for poetry quality?
   - Testing range from 5 to 100 words
   - Monitoring OpenAI response quality
   - Tracking processing time

2. How should we handle chunk sizes?
   - Currently using 100 characters
   - Need to test larger sizes
   - Balance processing speed vs word discovery

3. What configuration options should be command-line accessible?
   - Packet sizes
   - Chunk sizes
   - Poetry styles
   - Display options

## Resources üìö
- Project documentation in `/docs`
- Configuration tracking in `.cursor/working/tasks`
- Test files for reference
- Schema definitions in SQLite service

Remember to:
- Take regular breaks
- Commit frequently
- Update documentation
- Stay hydrated! üö∞
