# Sisyphus Monkey Project Status
Last Updated: March 2024

## Current Status 🎯

### ✅ Completed
1. **Dictionary Processing**
   - Dictionary files split by letter
   - TypeScript types defined
   - Trie implementation working

2. **Word Finding**
   - Trie service implemented and tested
   - Efficient caching system
   - Case-insensitive matching
   - SQLite integration complete
   - Subword discovery working

3. **Data Storage**
   - SQLite service implemented
   - Complete test coverage
   - Schema designed for:
     - Character chunks
     - Words
     - Word packets
     - Poems

4. **Word Packet Generation**
   - Configurable packet sizes
   - Sequence tracking
   - Word grouping logic
   - SQLite integration
   - Test coverage

### 🚧 In Progress
1. **Integration Points**
   - ✅ Connect word finding to SQLite storage
   - ✅ Create a simple word packet generator
   - Need to set up poetry generation

### 📋 Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **High Priority** (Next 30-45 minutes)
   - [x] Connect word finding to SQLite storage
   - [x] Create a simple word packet generator
   - [ ] Set up basic poetry generation with OpenAI

2. **Medium Priority** (Next 1-2 hours)
   - [ ] Add progress tracking via SQLite
   - [ ] Implement more sophisticated word grouping
   - [ ] Add error recovery for API failures

3. **Lower Priority** (Later)
   - [ ] Add visualization/UI
   - [ ] Optimize performance
   - [ ] Add more poetry styles

## Development Tips 🧠

### Focus Sessions
- Use 25-minute Pomodoro sessions for high-priority tasks
- Take 5-minute breaks between sessions
- After 4 sessions, take a longer 15-30 minute break

### Task Management
- Check off items as they're completed
- Update this status file regularly
- Keep notes on challenges/blockers

### Code Organization
- Keep related changes together
- Write tests as you go
- Document key decisions

## Questions & Considerations ❓
1. How should we handle word packet size?
   - ✅ Implemented configurable min/max sizes
   - ✅ Added break point detection
   - Consider adding coherence scoring
2. What poetry styles should we support initially?
   - Start with free verse
   - Consider haiku and limerick formats
3. Should we add progress visualization?
4. How can we make the system more resilient to errors?
